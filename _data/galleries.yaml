      I’m Peter d’Errico. I’ve been involved with Indigenous peoples’ legal issues for more than fifty years, beginning in 1968, fresh out of Yale Law School, as a legal services attorney with Dinébe'iiná Náhiiłna be Agha'diit'ahii, the Navajo legal services project. I taught Legal Studies for more than thirty years at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. During the whole time, I represented and consulted with Native clients in state and federal litigation.
